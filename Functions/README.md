Prior to running any MATLAB code, you need to build the MEX function “msfm2d” by running the command “mex msfm2d.c” —- NOTE: this only seems to work on MATLAB R2016a or earlier. I have included the compiled MEX function for Mac OS X and Linux, but for other operating systems you have to run “mex msfm2d.c” —- Once again, this “mex msfm2d.c” compilation step may not work in the newer versions of MATLAB.
